// Whole-file writes that leave either the old file or the new one on disk,
// never a torn one, and the pid lock the shell's settings functions take.
//
// The two configuration files EmulationStation owns -- system.cfg and
// es_settings.cfg -- used to be rewritten in place: truncate, then write.
// A process killed between the two, or a battery that dies there, leaves an
// empty or half-written file, and the boot-time check then replaced the good
// copy with it (fork #102, D-CLOUD-078). Written to a temporary name, synced,
// and renamed into place, the file on disk is always a complete one; the
// directory is synced afterwards so the rename itself survives a power cut.
//
// Every guarantee in this file is POSIX's, and holds on Linux, which is all
// ROCKNIX builds (#307 PL-075). The _WIN32 branches keep upstream's Windows
// build compiling and nothing more: writeText there removes `path` before it
// renames the temporary into place, so a crash between the two leaves no file
// at all; its temporary is the shared `path`.tmp; the lock is never taken
// (acquire answers true); and the mode is not kept.
