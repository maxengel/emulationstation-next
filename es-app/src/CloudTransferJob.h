// One run of a transfer command -- a back up, a restore or a match as
// GuiMenu composes them, or the journey's first restore -- apart from the
// page that shows it (GuiCloudTransfer), so the page can be left and the
// run goes on (fork #187). A 1.4 GiB restore is an hour on a handheld's
// Wi-Fi, and the fourth surface tier (es-native-ui.md) is a page that
// outlives the job, not one that holds the player for its length; the scan
// page's OfflineScanJob (audit #186 PL-07) is the model this follows.
//
// The run is a thread of its own reading the command's stdout -- rclone's
// stats blocks and the scripts' ">>> " lines; handleLine is the reader and
// its comment the contract -- into the state below, and it keeps itself
// alive (the thread holds the shared_ptr) until the command exits, whether
// or not a page is watching. One run at a time: start() hands back the run
// in flight when there is one, as the scripts' own flock would refuse a
// second (CloudExit::LockHeld). A finished run stays current() until a page
// has shown its outcome and been dismissed (dismiss()), so the row that
// launched it can say how it went and a press can open the outcome page --
// with TRY AGAIN on it -- however long nobody was watching.
//
// The page is the run's one view and reads the state under mMutex as a
// friend: forty fields, every one of them a row on the page, and a copy of
// them per frame would be the pattern for its own sake.
