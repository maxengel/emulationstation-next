// A screen for a transfer that takes minutes, not seconds.
//
// The progress card is the right surface for work you can keep playing
// through -- a scrape, a hash. It is the wrong one for a restore: the card
// closes itself when the job ends, and a 1.4 GiB restore is precisely the
// thing somebody walks away from. Come back to a sleeping handheld and the
// only record that anything happened is a log file.
//
// So a long transfer owns the screen and stays there until it is dismissed.
// The result is the last thing on it, not the first thing to disappear.
//
// And it is left running, not sat in (fork #187; the scan page is the
// model, audit #186 PL-07): the run is a CloudTransferJob apart from this
// page, B while it runs closes the page and the run goes on, the row that
// launched it on the CLOUD page follows the run in its line, pressing that
// row opens this page on the run again -- or on the outcome, once it has
// ended -- and the outcome is what a page opened after the end shows.
// Every other press is refused while it runs, because there is nothing to
// choose. A page whose completed run has an action in place of an exit
// (a settings restore: the configuration under this process is being
// replaced, #114) is the exception and takes every button, as it did.

	// stale, and the next thing that writes them puts the old ones back
	// over the new. So the page's only exit becomes the action -- any
	// button takes it -- and the three strings say so: `helpVerb` is the
	// word on the help bar, `footer` is line 7, and `note` is line 5, what
	// happens next. Nothing is called when the run did not complete; TRY
	// AGAIN and CLOSE apply then exactly as they always do (#114). A page
