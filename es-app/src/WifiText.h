// The pure text of the Wi-Fi rows (fork #191): what wifictl prints for the
// interface, read into values the pages can show, with nothing from the
// window, the settings or a script behind it, so es-unit-tests can hold the
// rules (es-app/tests/unit). The thin shells that run wifictl are in
// ApiSystem; the rows themselves are in GuiMenu.
//
// The setting wifi.ssid is the network the player configured last.
// NetworkManager keeps a profile for every network the device has joined and
// autoconnects to whichever remembered one is in range, so what the device is
// on and what the setting says are two different facts; these are the shapes
// wifictl reports the first in.
