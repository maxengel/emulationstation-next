// One run of raofflineproxy-ctl scan (fork #179, D-RA-010), apart from the
// page that shows it (GuiOfflineScan). The run is a thread of its own
// reading the ctl's stdout -- ">>> " lines, the header of raofflineproxy-ctl
// is the contract -- into the state below, and it keeps itself alive (the
// thread holds the shared_ptr) until the ctl exits. One run at a time:
// start() hands back the run in flight when there is one, as the ctl itself
// would refuse a second (exit 75).
//
// The page sits on the run for its length (D-UI-078, #241): the one way out
// while it runs is CANCEL, which is cancel() here -- the ctl gets SIGINT,
// traps it as the player's cancel, stamps the run and exits 130; what it
// saved stays saved, and the next scan passes over those games. For a week
// (audit #186 PL-07) the page could be left and the run went on in the
// background, reported only on the row that launched it; the maintainer met
// that prompt on the device and asked what would happen, and the honest
// answer was "nothing tells you".
