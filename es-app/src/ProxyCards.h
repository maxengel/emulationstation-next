// The offline-achievements proxy's two automatic jobs that move data over
// the network, shown while they run (fork #292, #293; D-UI-095, D-RA-030):
// the proxy's send of the awards it held while the device was offline, and
// the ctl's top-up of the achievement sets for recently played games. Each
// is a card in the sync card's shape, one at a time (D-UI-093), and a game
// launch over either asks (FileData::launchGame). The proxy sends on its
// own the moment RetroAchievements answers again; the interface's part is
// to show it, and to run the exit sync that was skipped for want of a
// network, which the exit card had promised for "next time you're
// connected" without anything behind the promise.
