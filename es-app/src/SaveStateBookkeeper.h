// SaveStateBookkeeper - the save state manager's bookkeeping, off the
// interface thread (fork #205 / #206, D-UI-073).
//
// DELETE used to run `cloud_capture --retire` and `--rescan` through popen
// on the interface thread and redraw the grid only when both had exited:
// two bash starts, a dozen jq starts and a fork of a 350 MB process each,
// about a third of a second on the x86_64 guest and a second on a Cortex-A53,
// felt as the dialog hanging after YES. Now the manager hides the tile the
// same frame and hands the work to one worker thread, one job at a time.
//
// A deletion is one unit inside the script: `cloud_capture --retire --unlink`
// writes the retired row and then unlinks the files itself, and the script
// ignores SIGTERM while it runs, so a `systemctl stop` that ends
// EmulationStation mid-deletion leaves either both or neither (D-CLOUD-133;
// build 9 could leave the row and the file). Should the script be absent or
// fail before the unlink, the worker unlinks what is left: the player asked
// for the deletion and it proceeds whatever the record said. The rescan is
// gone (D-CLOUD-132): it re-keyed slots the renumber had moved, and nothing
// renumbers since D-UI-069.
//
// A copy made with COPY TO FREE SLOT is recorded the same way, on the worker,
// through `cloud_capture --adopt` (#206): the file is real the moment it is
// copied and its tile shows at once; the manifest learns of it a moment
// later, as the source's version at the new path.
//
// The rules (D-UI-073), because each guards a way this can crash or lie:
//   - the worker holds path strings per job and never a pointer to a page
//     or to the repository's SaveState, both of which die under it; a page
//     learns a job is done by polling completed() in update();
//   - one queue, one job at a time (SaveStateJobQueue), so two quick jobs
//     never race the manifest;
//   - shutdown() joins the worker at exit; a joinable std::thread destroyed
//     at static teardown would terminate the process instead.
