// What the offline RetroAchievements proxy answers, read as text (fork
// #180, D-RA-009). With OFFLINE ACHIEVEMENTS on and the device offline, the
// achievements pages read the proxy's on-device cache through the same
// dorequest.php actions RetroArch uses, and this is the pure reading of
// those answers -- the shapes captured from a guest's proxy on 2026-09-14:
//
//   patch            {"Success":true,"PatchData":{"ID","Title","ImageIcon",
//                    "Achievements":[{"ID","Title","Description","Points",
//                    "BadgeName","Flags","BadgeURL","BadgeLockedURL",...}]}}
//                    -- a game the scan cached, keyed by game id;
//   achievementsets  {"Success":true,"GameId","Title","ImageIconUrl",
//                    "Sets":[{"Type":"core","Achievements":[same]}]}
//                    -- a game started once through RetroArch, keyed by hash;
//   unlocks          {"Success":true,"UserUnlocks":[100359]} -- the cached
//                    unlocks merged with the awards still queued; an unknown
//                    game answers 200 with an empty list, so this never
//                    decides whether a game is cached;
//   a miss           503 {"Success":false,"Error":"no cached response"}.
//
// Nothing here reads a file, asks SystemConf, opens a socket or measures a
// font, so es-unit-tests checks it (es-app/tests/unit). OfflineAchievements
// does the asking; RetroAchievements turns the model into the page's.
//
// Translation stays outside on purpose: no _() here.
